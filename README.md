- `python-dotenv`: Loads environment variables from `.env`.
- `requests`: For making HTTP requests to the Gemini API.
- `pytz`: Timezone support (not currently used, but may be useful for future features).
- `openai`: OpenAI API client (not used in current code, but can be used for GPT models).

### 3. `bot.py`

This is the main bot script. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of its structure:

#### Imports

- `os`, `logging`: Standard Python modules for environment and logging.
- `dotenv.load_dotenv`: Loads environment variables from `.env`.
